Let the VC dimenstion of $H_i$ be $d_i$.
$d = \underset{i}{\max} d_i$

**Notation**: Let $A := \cup_i^k H_i$


The growth function of a function class $H$ is the cardinality of length n bit-patterns $B(H,x_{1:n})$ realizable on a set of points $X_{1:n}$ by functions $h \in H$. It can atmost be $2^n$ when $n \leq VCdim(H)$ as each length n bit-patterns is realized by some member of $h \in H$ when it is restricted to the points $x_1,x_2,...,x_n$.

From lecture notes, the growth function is also bounded above by $\#B(H,x_{1:n}) = G_{H_i}(n) \leq \sum_{j=0}^{d_i} \binom{n}{j} \leq  \sum_{j=0}^{d} \binom{n}{j}$.


Given a set of points $x_{1:n}$ and  for all $n$, the number of bit-patterns realized by some member of $H_i$ is $\#B(H_i,x_{1:n}) \leq  \sum_{j=0}^{d_i} \binom{n}{j} \leq  \sum_{j=0}^{d} \binom{n}{j}$.

The set of bit-patters $B(A,x_{1:n})$ realized by $A = \cup_i^k$ is the union of the bit-patterns that is realized by any of its subsets $H_i$.

$$
 B(A,x_{1:n}) = \cup_i^k B(H_i, x_{1:n})
$$

By union bound, 

$$
\#B(A,x_{1:n}) \leq \sum_i^k B(H_i, x_{1:n}) \leq \sum_i^k  \sum_{j=0}^{d_i} \binom{n}{j}
$$

$$
\# B(A, x_{1:n}) \leq k  \sum_{j=0}^{d} \binom{n}{j}
$$

By proposition in lecture notes (also appendix D.1), 

$$
\# B(A, x_{1:n}) \leq k  \sum_{j=0}^{d} \binom{n}{j} \leq k \bigg(\frac{en}{d}\bigg)^d
$$


Let $m$ be the size of some set $x_{1:m}$ that can be shattered by $A$. $VCdim{A}$ is the largest such $m$.
The below inequality holds only if there exists any $x_{1:m}$ that is shattered by $A$. 

Then, $ 2^m = \# B(A,x_{1:m}) \leq k \big( \frac{en}{d}\big)^d$

$$ 2^m \leq k \bigg( \frac{em}{d}\bigg)^d $$

$$ m \ln2 \leq \ln k + d (\ln(em) - \ln{d} ) $$


Assuming $d \geq 1$ and hence  $\ln d \geq 0$, we have

$$ m \ln 2 \leq \ln k + d(\ln em) \hspace{0.5em} --- (1)$$

From hint,  $2b \ln (2bc) \leq m  \implies  b \ln (cm) \leq m $.


We want to show that for large $m$, $A$ cannot shatter $x_{1:m}$

Set $2b = 2d$, $c = e$. Assume that we have a large $m$ such that $2b \ln(2bc) = 2d \ln (2de) \leq m$. In this large $m$ regime, we have $ d \ln (em) \leq m$.

Hence, from (1)

$$
	m \ln 2 \leq \ln k  + d (\ln em) \leq \ln k + m
$$

$$
	m (\ln 2 - 1) \leq \ln k $$
$$
	\implies m \leq \underbrace{0}_{c_0} d + \underbrace{\frac{1}{\ln 2 - 1}}_{c_1} \ln k 
$$
